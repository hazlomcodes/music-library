Music-Libary

This project seeks to improve my understanding of backend fundamentals through constructing a music library API.

This API is built in JavaScript and uses Express.Js as its framework. 

The project also utilises Docker, PgAdmin4 and Postman.

This exercise has been provided by ManchesterCodes as part of the backend section of their 6 month fullstack bootcamp.
